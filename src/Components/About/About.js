					        <p>Hi, my name is Dirk Jansen van Rensburg, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I have been doing Web development for Â± 2 years. Within this time I have also created my own freelance web design company  <a href="https://focuswebdesign.co.za" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Focus Web Design</a>. </p>
					        <p>I am a quick learner and I constantly strive to learn new skills, pushing to myself to grow and keep up-to-date with the latest web technologies.</p>
					        <p>I have been employed full-time by Arwyp Medical Centre for the last 8+ years. My duties include developing and maintaining their hospital management system, using the BASIC programming language.  The recent systematic integration of the system with dynamic web technologies is what has sparked my passion into the world of web development. This has resulted in numerous sites being setup for the hospital which are all linked to a central server.</p>
